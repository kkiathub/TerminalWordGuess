There is no deployed version of this application since this is a javascript node application running on the terminal.   You can however view , download, and try running the code from github, but you will need to create your own .env for authentication purpose.

    - Inquirer package is used to prompt the new game confirmation.
    - We use recursive function when user is guessing letters.
